The prime minister of the Central African Republic’s (CAR) has announced a caretaker government, following a coup that ousted the country’s former president.

Nicolas Tiangaye named Sunday a 34-member cabinet, including mostly opposition figures and Seleka fighters, who overthrew the former President Michel Bozize’s government a week earlier.

Self-proclaimed President Michel Djotodia received the title of defense minister and eight other members from his Seleka party were appointed minister posts, including for petroleum, security, water and forestry, and communications.

Djotodia claimed on Saturday that the transitional government would rule until elections are held in 2016.

This comes as the former president was forced to leave the country on March 24 after Seleka fighters advanced to the capital, Bangui. The fighters had launched an insurgency in December 2012, accusing the Bozize of not honoring earlier peace deals.

There are many mineral resources in the Central African Republic. However, the country is extremely poor and has faced a series of rebellions and coups since it gained independence in 1960.
