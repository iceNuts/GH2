The 94-year-old former president and Nobel peace laureate has been in hospital since late on Wednesday over a recurrent bout of pneumonia.

"He spent part of Family Day today with some members of his family," the presidency said in a statement in its first update on Mandela's health on Monday.

"There is no significant change in his condition" since the previous presidency statement on Sunday night, which said doctors had reported "a further improvement in his condition".

In a report on Saturday, the presidency said doctors had drained excess fluid that had built up on the lining of his lungs because of infection.

The procedure, described as the tapping of a pleural effusion, has helped him breathe without difficulty, it said.

South Africa's revered first black president was admitted to an undisclosed hospital late on Wednesday for his third hospitalisation in four months. It remains unclear how long he may stay.

In December last year, he was in hospital for 18 days for treatment for the lung infection and gallstones surgery, his longest admission since he walked free from jail in 1990.

He was diagnosed with early-stage tuberculosis in 1988 during his 27-year jail term and has long had problems with his lungs. He has also had treatment for prostate cancer and has suffered stomach ailments.
